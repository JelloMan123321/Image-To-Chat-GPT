Hi there! I need help with a web-based image conversion program. I have created a program that takes an image and converts it into a binary representation consisting of 1s and 0s, where 1 represents black and 0 represents white. Now, I would like to discuss the binary output with you. Could you please assist me in analyzing the image based on the binary representation?
